# Reinforcement Learning on FrozenLake

This project demonstrates different Reinforcement Learning algorithms on the classic FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

All algorithms are implemented in separate files:

- **Random Agent** â€“ takes random actions
- **Value Iteration** â€“ uses dynamic programming to solve the MDP
- **Q-Learning** â€“ model-free off-policy learning
- **Deep Q-Learning** â€“ uses a neural network to approximate Q-values

## ðŸ’¡ Goal

Solve the FrozenLake-v1 environment with different strategies and compare their performance.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `gym`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
